# EFCodeFirst
An Entity Framework Code-First project to facilitate a basic To Do List API that uses a local MS SQL Server DB.  
Interfaced through Android Application (**Todo App**) and Web API (**EFCodeFirst**).

This has been a project of mine to help with the basic concepts of working with APIs following the Entity Framework Code First approach; the Android app has been designed with simple CRUD operations, some which still need implementation.
